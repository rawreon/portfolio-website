I just graduated from university in May 2021, and am looking for an opportunity to apply my skills. What I lack in experience I make up with the ability to learn at an accelerated rate. I have a laser focus and dedication to complete any task to the best of my ability. In my free time I like to catch up on competitive Valorant or even play the occasional game myself. Reach out to me if you have any questions, or just talk gaming.",
